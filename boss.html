</script><tw-passagedata pid="1" name="intro" tags="" position="3,4">Good morning, honored mayor!
It&#x27;s a beautiful Saturday morning, and you peek out the window.

10 AM! A slight bubble of embarrassment arises in you, but you quickly rationalize that a person as hardworking as yourself deserves these long hours of slumber.

Onwards from our inner rant.

Your mighty mayoral stomach is rumbling.

What is your extremely informed, unbiased choice of meal?

[[Pancakes|Pancakes]]

[[Cereal]] 

[[Waffles]] 


Note: This tale is rife with symbolism. Keep your eyes peeled.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="2" name="Pancakes" tags="" position="1,152">What? Pancakes?? Heresy.

No person with a status such as yours shall regress to the plebeian dish known as //Pancakes//. Shudder. 

Let&#x27;s try this again, shall we?

[[Cereal]] 

[[Waffles]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="3" name="Cereal" tags="" position="6,303">Some cereal would really help out with the gaping pit in your stomach.

Unfortunately for you, the milk in the fridge is spoiled! Again!
Who keeps forgetting the groceries?

Whatever. That is a problem for future mayor.
Current mayor still needs to eat.

[[Pancakes]] 

[[Waffles]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="4" name="Waffles" tags="" position="191,186">Ah, yes, some waffles, the perfect mayoral food. Beautiful, golden, and totally unhealthy, they&#x27;re the perfect food for easing your constant, crippling trepidation.

Before we sink too deep into a pit of self-pity, let&#x27;s get these waffles started.

[[Get some batter.|Batter]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="Batter" tags="" position="398,193">You find yourself pondering as you procure the necessary ingredients for your fluffy mental pain relievers.

Those weak, insignificant citizens...err...eggs stand no chance against your dictatorial power! You beat them into submission with brute force, and you&#x27;re soon left with a bowl of broken shells and golden yolks.

Ah, yes. This is progressing quite well!

[[Onwards.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="Onwards." tags="" position="605,198">Fumbling through your shelves that are annoyingly full of gilded utensils, you finally manage to extract your prized waffle maker.

Ever since you were a young boy, the giddiness of impressing the lid onto batter was difficult to replicate. You loved the total control you could occasionally exert over your powerless subjects.

[[Plug &#x27;er in.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="Plug &#x27;er in." tags="" position="801,199">You haphazardly insert the plug into the wall (nothing can dare harm the mighty mayor, not even electricity!).

While your beloved machine warms up, it might be a good time to procure the condiments you will implant into your waffles.

[[Chocolate Chips.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="Chocolate Chips." tags="" position="1005,200">Ah yes, delicious, rich chocolate chips.

Your favorite part about them is the way they oh-so-subtly influence the flavor of your waffles. Their implanation is completely at your discretion.

It&#x27;s like the batter doesn&#x27;t even notice....

[[Procure the Syrup||Syrup.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="Syrup." tags="" position="1196,203">Time for the sugary goop fawned over by generations of children on Saturday mornings. 

You eye the syrup carefully, admiring its traits.

It glimmers in the morning sun, the crystals of sugar glowing faintly.

You anxiously await the completion of waffle, as no waffle is complete without your drizzle of power over it.

Ah yes, that reminds you. The machine should be warm now.

[[Begin the procedure.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Begin the procedure." tags="" position="1403,207">Ah, yes. The facade of your machine is gleaming in the light. It looks beautiful.

Even though its innards are soon to be filled with burning batter, the inside doesn&#x27;t matter. As long as it looks good!

[[Pour in the batter.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Pour in the batter." tags="" position="203,401">Your pour in your batter. 

It moves across the griddle slowly, almost with reluctance. While it was perfectly fine batter before, no batter can stay as such forever.

Batter needs the forceful hand of a strong leader like you to achieve its true potential.

And so, with the graceful motion of your trained hand, your sprinkle your chcocolate chips into the bubbling mass and close the lid.

[[Ponder as the waffle cooks]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Ponder as the waffle cooks" tags="" position="401,403">This process is immensely satisfying to your advanced mayoral brain.

You relish in the fact that this waffle is totally under your control, and that you alone hold its destiny in the palm of your hand.

That stupid waffle. It doesn&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s happening to it.

Ding! Looks like this one is done.

[[Examine your handiwork.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="Examine your handiwork." tags="" position="599,409">It appears this waffle was not cooked completely. Looks like you didn&#x27;t exert enough of your mighty mayoral cooking skill on the poor thing. 

Oh well. Into the trash it goes.

[[Let&#x27;s try that again.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="14" name="Let&#x27;s try that again." tags="" position="812,385">Ah, yes, waffle number two shall be perfection.

Before you can embark on this task, it appears the previous failure of a waffle left some residue on your beloved machine.

It faintly reminds you of the last echo of a silenced population, attempting to cause some sort of uproar before it was extinguished...

Or maybe it was just some batter! The world will never know.

[[Clean the machine and pour another waffle]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Clean the machine and pour another waffle" tags="" position="1001,405">This one just has to be perfect.

With another excellent pour, your machine is filled with the potential of a delicious, crispy waffle.

You grip the handle and feel intoxicated at the power you posess as you flip the lid down.

A satisfying sizzle emanates from the machine, and it&#x27;s time to wait.

The intoxicating feeling doesn&#x27;t disappear just yet.

You spend a good 10 minutes fantasizing about the perfect waffle.

Unfortunately, this one is precisely the opposite.

Snapping out of your fantasy to the smell of burnt batter, you quickly realize this waffle is toast. 

Ha Ha.

[[Third time&#x27;s the charm, I guess.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="16" name="Third time&#x27;s the charm, I guess." tags="" position="1197,404">It&#x27;s 10:45, and the mighty mayoral stomach&#x27;s aggression is growing.

You make a solemn ceremony out of this last waffle-the batter cup is empty, and you have no waffles to show for it.

With a nonchalant, absentminded tap, the lid closes gently.

Hunger&#x27;s myriad of negative effects are showing in you now-you feel angry! 

You seethe in anger at your loss of control over your emotions as the waffle quietly sizzles away in the corner.

...

[[DING!]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="DING!" tags="" position="1392,392">
You can *feel* yourself perk up at the chime of the waffle iron.

Your eyes anxiously scan the machine as you lift up the lid.

It appears as if your repetitious failure finally paid off, as a perfectly cooked, golden waffle glows before your eyes.

The scent of victory fills your nostrils, and the boyhood sense of giddiness fills your mind.

This waffle is too awesome to go unnamed.

As you ponder a name, a clump of hair falls off your head.

While exclaiming &quot;Oh, hair!&quot; you realize it is a perfect name for your waffle.

This point of pride will forever live on in your heart and legacy.</tw-passagedata></tw-storydata>
